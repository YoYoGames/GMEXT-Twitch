The Twitch API provides developers with powerful tools to create applications that interact with Twitch streams, users, and chats, enabling new ways to engage audiences and enhance the gaming experience.

The Twitch API allows developers to programmatically access Twitch’s features and data. Whether you want to retrieve information about streams, manage user accounts, interact with chat, or create and manage clips, the Twitch API offers endpoints to do so.
