        For in-game issues which also happen when this extension is not part of your project, or just when using GameMaker itself, DO NOT report that here. Use the Help menu inside GameMaker.
        
        Always ensure you're on the latest version of this extension before sending any bug reports!
        
        Also, search first of all for any existing reports of this bug - if one exists, DO NOT file your own duplicate - leave a thumbs-up or a comment on the existing report!
       
        Most fields are required to be filled-in before you can submit this report, as it is all essential/required information to confirm and fix your issue.

      label: Description
      description: Write a thorough description of the bug. Paste any relevant screenshots into here also. DO NOT paste more than a couple of code (send a sample project instead!) and DO NOT add a web URL and assume we will read the external thread to work the bug ourselves, as we will almost certainly just close the report!
